# To Do App

This is a To-do App made in Vue3, Vite using tailwind UI with DaisyUI.
I have used composition API in the same.
Also, used JSON-SERVER as a mock-api.

## Steps to setup
- In root on folder, run npm install to install the dependencies.
- To run frontend, run npm run dev
- To run mock API, npx json-server db.json

## Recommended IDE Setup
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur)
